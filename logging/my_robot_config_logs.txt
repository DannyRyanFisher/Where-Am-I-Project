Attempted solution: 
                increase global update & publish frequency from 0.6 and 0.5 to 6 and 5.

Attempeted solution: Reduce resolution value from 0.08 to 0.05 for global map
Did solution work? N;

Attempted solution Both resolution values at 0.05 (local from 0.02)
                    Then increase local costmap size from 5 by 5 to 15 by 15 

Problem: Robot getting stuck throughout map.
Image: 14-54- 

Solution: controller frequency; update rates; resolution; increasing torqu/ drive control in turning. 
Need to either get robot to turn sooner, before the 'black costmap'; to recognise the obstacles sooner and react quicker to avoidance. or to be able to turn more sharply.

How to reduce reaction time; reduce computational burden to increase frequency of map update; reduce speed of rover; increase update frequency; reduce map sizes to reduce computational time; increase controller frequency. 

Attempted solution: adjust controller frequency from 2.5Hz to 10Hz
change controller frequency from 10Hz to 5Hz

Did solution work? N;

Try increase update rate of drive controller from 10 to 20
Did solution work? N;

Next action: change drive controller rate back to default.

change raytrace rate from 2 to 4hz
change inflation radius from 0.4 to 0.3m

Does solution work? N;

Final parameters in image 

---------------------------- NEW SMALLER ROBOT --------------------------------
Try reduce size of robot and reset all values;
Reduce size of robot to radius of 0.1 with same size wheels; stem changed to 0.15m high; reduce weight from 15.0 chassis to 10.0

Did changes work? 

Y 15-54- ; N 16-00-01 N;

try moving laser scanner to front of robot; say 0.15 from centre along x axis

with all physical changes intact;

Robot's starting settings are:

Image: 16-24-09

Change inflation radius to 0.55 (default)

1) 
Problem: rover drives into walls
Image: 16-27-22

Increase inflation radius to 1m;

raytrace to 1
obstacle range to 0.5

decrease local costmap update and publish from 20Hz to 10Hz for both

increase obstacle range to 1.5m

Robot completing straight line test well. Just very laggy.
Decrease global frequencies to 7Hz
reduce global map size to 20 by 20

increase obstacle range to 2.5; raytrace increase to 2

Appears to work; just need to decrease experienced lag.

all costmap local and global variables set to 5hz;

increase the inflation radius to 5;

STOPPED LOGGING; too slow
